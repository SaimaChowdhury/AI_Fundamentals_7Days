**Linear Regression** → Draws the best straight line to predict continuous values (e.g., house prices).
* Formula: y=m\cdot x+b
* Metric: R² shows how well the line fits.


**Logistic Regression** → Used for classification (yes/no).
- Uses Sigmoid function to convert outputs into probabilities between 0 and 1.
- Metric: Accuracy measures correct predictions.
- Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:** Squashes values into [0,1], good for probabilities.


**ReLU:** Passes positive values, turns negatives into 0 → helps neural networks learn faster.


**Practice Projects:**
- Predict house prices (Linear Regression).
- Predict Titanic survival (Logistic Regression).
- Plot Sigmoid curve to visualize probabilities.

✨ Key takeaway: Linear regression predicts numbers, logistic regression predicts probabilities, and activation functions (Sigmoid & ReLU) help models make sense of inputs.
