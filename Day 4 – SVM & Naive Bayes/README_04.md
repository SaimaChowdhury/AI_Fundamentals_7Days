**📘 Day 4 – Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**

📖 Concepts Learned
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Classification models that find the best boundary between classes.
- Hyperplane: The decision boundary (line in 2D, plane in higher dimensions).
- Support Vectors: The closest data points to the boundary that define it.
- Margin: The distance between the boundary and the nearest points; SVM maximizes this margin.
- Kernel Trick: A method to transform data into higher dimensions to make it separable.

🧪 Examples & Practice
- Implemented a Linear SVM on a toy dataset to classify points.
- Visualized the decision boundary and support vectors.
- Experimented with Non‑Linear SVM using RBF kernel for overlapping classes.
- Compared performance between linear and kernel SVMs.

🔑 Key Takeaways
- SVMs aim to maximize the margin, making boundaries more robust.
- Support vectors are critical — they alone define the boundary.
- Kernels allow SVMs to handle complex, non‑linear data.
- Visualization helps in understanding how SVM separates classes.

📊 Metrics Learned
- Accuracy → overall correctness of predictions.
- Precision & Recall → useful for imbalanced datasets.

📝 Reflections
- SVMs felt like drawing the “best possible line” between groups.
- Support vectors showed me that not all points matter equally — only the closest ones do.
- Kernel trick was eye‑opening: it’s like magic that makes impossible separations possible.
- Visualizing boundaries made the math much easier to grasp.
