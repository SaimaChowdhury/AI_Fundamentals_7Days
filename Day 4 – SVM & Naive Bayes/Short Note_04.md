📌 **Day 4 – Support Vector Machines (Short Note)**

- SVM → Finds the best boundary (hyperplane) between classes.
- Support Vectors → Closest points to the boundary, define the margin.
- Margin → Distance between boundary and nearest points; SVM maximizes it.
- Linear SVM → Straight line separation.
- Kernel SVM → Handles curved boundaries using kernel trick (e.g., RBF).
- Kernel Trick → Transforms data into higher dimensions to make it separable.
- Metrics → Accuracy, Precision, Recall.

✨ Key takeaway: SVM = “best possible separator.” Support vectors are the most important points, and kernels make SVM powerful for complex data.
