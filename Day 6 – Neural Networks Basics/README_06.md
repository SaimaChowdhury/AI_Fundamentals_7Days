📘 **Day 5 – Neural Networks Basics**

📖 Concepts Learned
- Neural Networks: Systems of connected nodes (neurons) inspired by the brain.
- Layers:
- Input Layer → receives features.
- Hidden Layers → process information.
- Output Layer → produces predictions.
- Weights & Biases: Control the strength of connections.
- Activation Functions: Decide if a neuron “fires” (Sigmoid, ReLU).
- Forward Propagation: Data flows forward through the network.
- Backpropagation: Errors flow backward to adjust weights using gradient descent.

🧪 Examples & Practice
- Built a simple neural network for binary classification.
- Compared Sigmoid vs ReLU activation functions.
- Visualized the loss curve during training.

🔑 Key Takeaways
- Neural networks are like “mini brains” that learn patterns.
- Activation functions are crucial for introducing non‑linearity.
- Backpropagation is the learning mechanism — correcting mistakes step by step.
- Visualizing the loss curve shows how the network improves over time.

📊 Metrics Learned
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
- Cross‑Entropy Loss: Measures prediction error for classification tasks.

📝 Reflections
- Neural networks felt like a big leap from SVMs — more flexible and powerful.
- The analogy of a classroom helped me understand how neurons collaborate.
- Playing with activation functions showed how they change the network’s behavior.
- Visualizing the loss curve boosted my confidence in how the network learns.
