📘 Day 7 – Model Evaluation & Validation

📖 Concepts Learned
- Model evaluation ensures that algorithms generalize beyond training data and don’t just memorize.
- Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‑score provide different perspectives on performance.
- Confusion matrices help visualize correct vs incorrect predictions.
- Validation techniques (train/test split, cross‑validation) provide fair and robust testing.
- Overfitting checks compare training vs testing accuracy to ensure models aren’t memorizing.

🧪 Examples & Practice
- Implemented train/test split on datasets and measured accuracy.
- Built confusion matrices to visualize errors.
- Compared precision, recall, and F1‑score for imbalanced datasets.
- Applied k‑fold cross‑validation to fairly compare models like KNN, SVM, and Decision Trees.

🔑 Key Takeaways
- Accuracy alone can be misleading, especially with imbalanced data.
- Precision and recall balance correctness vs completeness.
- F1‑score is a good single metric when both precision and recall matter.
- Cross‑validation provides a more reliable estimate of model performance.
- Confusion matrices make mistakes visible and actionable.

📊 Metrics Learned
- Accuracy: Overall correctness.
- Precision: Correctness of positive predictions.
- Recall: Coverage of actual positives.
- F1‑Score: Balance between precision and recall.
- Confusion Matrix: Breakdown of predictions.

📝 Reflections
- Evaluating models felt like giving them an exam — proving they learned, not memorized.
- Precision and recall reminded me of two sides of a coin: one checks correctness, the other checks completeness.
- Cross‑validation was like practicing with multiple mock exams before the real test.
- Confusion matrices gave me a clear picture of where models stumble.
