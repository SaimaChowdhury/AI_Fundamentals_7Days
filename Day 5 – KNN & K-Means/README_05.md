**📘 Day 6 – KNN & K‑Means**

📖 Concepts Learned
- K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
- A classification algorithm that predicts labels based on the majority vote of k nearest neighbors.
- Relies on distance metrics (commonly Euclidean).
- Sensitive to choice of k and scaling of features.
- K‑Means Clustering:
- An unsupervised algorithm that groups data into k clusters.
- Each cluster has a centroid (mean point).
- Iteratively assigns points to nearest centroid and updates centroids until stable.

🧪 Examples & Practice
- Implemented KNN classifier on the Iris dataset.
- Experimented with different values of k (3, 5, 7) and observed accuracy changes.
- Applied K‑Means clustering on unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- Visualized clusters with scatter plots.

🔑 Key Takeaways
- KNN is simple yet effective, but computationally heavy for large datasets.
- Choosing the right k is crucial — too small = noisy, too large = oversimplified.
- K‑Means discovers hidden structure without labels, but requires choosing k beforehand.
- Visualization makes clustering results intuitive and easy to interpret.

📊 Metrics Learned
- KNN: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
- K‑Means: Inertia (sum of squared distances), Silhouette Score.

📝 Reflections
- KNN felt like asking neighbors for advice — simple but surprisingly powerful.
- K‑Means was like sorting marbles into buckets — satisfying to see clusters form.
- Both algorithms rely on distance and similarity as their foundation.
- Visualizing results made the concepts click instantly.
