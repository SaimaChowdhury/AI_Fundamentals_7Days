**📌 Day 5 – Neural Networks (Short Note)**
- Neural Network → A system of connected nodes (neurons) inspired by the brain.
- Layers:
- Input → receives features.
- Hidden → processes information.
- Output → gives predictions.
- Weights & Biases → control strength of connections.
- Activation Functions:
- Sigmoid → squashes values between 0 and 1.
- ReLU → passes positives, zeros out negatives.
- Forward Propagation → data flows forward.
- Backpropagation → errors flow backward to adjust weights.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Cross‑Entropy Loss.

✨ Key takeaway: Neural networks are “mini brains” that learn patterns. Activations add flexibility, backpropagation makes them smarter with each step.
