🚀 Overview
This repository documents my 7‑day journey into the fundamentals of Machine Learning and AI.
The goal is to build strong basics in theory and practice, using simple examples, analogies, and small coding projects.
Each day focuses on a specific set of concepts, with notebooks, notes, and reflections uploaded here.

📂 Structure
- Day 1 – Regression Basics
Linear & Logistic Regression, Sigmoid, ReLU, R², Accuracy
→ Day1_Regression
- Day 2 – Decision Trees & Random Forest
Entropy, Information Gain, Tree splitting, Ensemble learning
→ Day2_Trees
- Day 3 – Gradient Descent
Optimization, learning rate, RMSE
→ Day3_GradientDescent
- Day 4 – SVM & Naive Bayes
Decision boundaries, kernel trick, probability-based classification
→ Day4_SVM_NaiveBayes
- Day 5 – KNN & K-Means
Classification by neighbors, clustering groups
→ Day5_KNN_KMeans
- Day 6 – Neural Networks Basics
Neurons, layers, activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU)
→ Day6_NeuralNetworks
- Day 7 – Model Evaluation & Final Project
Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1, Cross-validation
→ Day7_Evaluation

📊 Metrics Learned
- Regression: R², RMSE
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC
- Validation: Cross-validation

📝 Reflections
- Focused on understanding theory first, then coding.
- Used analogies (like tea/coffee recipes) to simplify concepts.
- Built small projects to reinforce learning.
- Documented progress daily with notebooks and notes.

✨ By the end of this journey, I’ve built a strong foundation in AI basics and created a portfolio of practice projects.
